# Train-to-Mountain
This is an ongoing personal website. Its purpose is to show young people in Romania and beyond, how to reach any mountain route with the help of public transport, especially the train. This project started as a school project in the "Web Techniques" course and I want to turn it into one of the most used sites by mountain people.
